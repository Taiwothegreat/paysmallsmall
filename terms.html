  <p>Item(s) in the PaySmallSmall App are to be purchased on installment; however, a buyer who desires to buy outrightly may select the one-off payment. Buyer(s) may change a chosen instalment plan anytime before the delivery of the item(s) is being processed.</p>

  <p>All orders for purchase are subject to approval.</p>

  <p>The Installment Plan allows a buyer to pay for an order in equal consecutive installments of desired even numbers of weeks or months e.g. 4 weeks, 2 months, 6 months etc. Any duration for payment as chosen by a Buyer must run its course, and the Buyer cannot review the period once the item(s) has been processed for delivery.</p>

  <p>PaySmallSmall reserves the right to reject, modify, or cancel an order if any information provided by the Buyer is found to be inaccurate, false, or unverifiable. PaySmallSmall also reserves the right to determine the eligibility of any Buyer for installment purchase based on credit assessment or history.</p>

  <p>Buyers are required to make all installment payments as scheduled. Failure to make payment on time may result in penalties, delayed delivery, or cancellation of the order.</p>

  <p>Ownership of the item(s) remains with PaySmallSmall until full payment has been made. The Buyer only gains ownership upon completion of the final installment.</p>

  <p>In the event of default, PaySmallSmall reserves the right to withdraw the product or initiate recovery procedures. Any advance payments made before cancellation due to default may be forfeited based on company policy.</p>

  <p>All item(s) purchased through PaySmallSmall come with the manufacturer’s warranty (where applicable). PaySmallSmall will not be held liable for defects or damages beyond the manufacturer’s warranty terms.</p>

  <p>By placing an order or making installment payments on the PaySmallSmall App or website, the Buyer agrees to abide by these Terms and Conditions and any other applicable company policies or laws governing digital transactions.</p>
